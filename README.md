## Summary of the Seminar:

>This simple robot is designed to be able to follow a black line on the ground without getting off the line too much. the robot has to senesors installed underneath the front part of the body, and two DC motors drive wheels moving forward. A circuit inside takes an input signal from two sensors and constrols the speed of the wheel rotation. The control is done in such a way that when a sensor senses a blck line, the motor slows down or even stops. the difference in speeds of wheel rotation makes the robot to turn.
